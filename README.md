The repository is a personal homework assignment of the Methods-and-models-for-multivariate-data-analysis course. The project was created solely to reflect the educational activities in the 1st year of the master's program. The author is not responsible for the actions of people who decide to submit assignments at someone else's expense by providing the code from this repository.
Task-1:
Table of contents:

Step 1. Choose subsample with main variables for your further analysis. Then for each of
them:

Step 2. You need to make a non-parametric estimation of PDF in form of histogram and using
kernel density function (or probability law in case of discrete RV).

Step 3. You need to make an estimation of order statistics and represent them as “box with
whiskers” plot.

Step 4. Find one or several theoretical distributions that could describe your sample on a
basis of non-parametric analysis results.

Step 5. Estimate parameters of chosen distributions using methods of maximum likelihood
and least squares method.

Step 6. Validate your estimated parameters using QQ biplots.

Step 7. Estimate correctness of fitted distributions using at least 2 statistical tests.

Task-2:

Step 1. You need to make a non-parametric estimation of PDF in form of histogram and using
kernel density function for MRV (or probability law in case of discrete MRV) .

Step 2. You need to make an estimation of multivariate mathematical expectation and
variance.

Step 3. You need to make a non-parametric estimation of conditional distributions,
mathematical expectations and variances.

Step 4. You need to make an estimation of pair correlation coefficients, confidence intervals
for them and significance levels.

Step 5. Choose a task formulation for regression. Estimate multivariate correlation (target -
predictors).

Step 6. Build regression model and make an analysis of multicollinearity and regularization (if
needed).

Step 7. Analyze the quality of regression model (distribution of residuals, determination
coefficient).


Task-3

Step 1. Choose variables for sampling from your dataset (overall – about 10 variables, 3-4 –
target variables, the rest - predictors).

Step 2. Using univariate parametric distributions that were fitted in Lab#2 make sampling of
chosen target variables. Use for this 2 different sampling methods.

Step 3. Estimate relations between predictors and chosen target variables. At least, they
should have significant correlation coefficients.

Step 4. Build a Bayesian network for chosen set of variables. Choose its structure on the basis
of multivariate analysis and train distributions in nodes using chosen algorithm.

Step 5. Build a Bayesian network for the same set of variables but using 2 chosen algorithms
for structural learning.

Step 6. Analyze a quality of sampled target variables from the point of view of problem
statement (e.g. prediction, gap filling, synthetic generation).
